									<h3>Don't apologize</h3>

								<div class="post-body">
									<p>Don't apologize for telling someone how you feel; weather it's something good or bad. Don't apologize for your honesty or your feelings. Don't apologize for protecting your heart whether by being too guarded or walking away too soon. Sometimes you're the only one who knows how to heal yourself. Don't apologize for following your heart either. Don't apologize for making a decision that will make you happy. Even if it might disappoint some people, if you truly believe it's right for you, you should not feel guilty about it. Don't apologize for treating someone the same way they treat you. Don't apologize for your vulnerability. For crying when you're upset, for needing space when you're confused and don't apologize for the way you choose to handle your pain. Don't apologize for being a bad friend to someone who wasn't there for you when you needed them. You learn who your true friends are when times get rough. Don't apologize for talking about love. Don't apologize for being heartbroken when things don't work out. The people who make you feel bad about your emotions are the people who truly don't understand you. Don't apologize for the nights you want to stay in when everyone wants to go out. You don't have to always please people, you don't have to always go out of your way. Don't apologize for how you choose to spend your money. Whether you eat out a lot travel a lot or shop a lot. You shouldn't have to explain to anyone what you do with your money and why you're not trying to save more. Don't apologize for taking a chance on someone who's wrong for you. Don't listen to the 'I told you so' and 'we warned you'. Don't apologize for falling for someone's potential. We all do it. Don't apologize for asking for closure. It's not a crime.It's not too needy. It's not too crazy. It's your right.</p>
