											<p>During the time I've done work for wineracksamerica. I helped and shaped their internal servers. To be connect and share server files within the company. It started back as a starter project at home accessing my home server to send and retrieve files whenever needed. This scoped into a larger scale for a company. It wasn't professionally done. However it got the job done, for what it was, and for others who was crazy enough to invest in the idea. At the time I was there, the server was up to 4 machines. Aside from building their intranet server. I maintained their website, among the various projects that were on going it was a sensitive website due to its internal infrastructure. Custom platform, built upon layers of many javascript. Moving the entire website into a new platform over night proven to be a nightmare. With the lack of support and a team to help build out the system. I was looking at a year and half project. Ideally in the long run, I probably would have driven myself insane trying to patch all the little components together.</p>
